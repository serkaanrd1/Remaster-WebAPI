# .Net Backend Project 

A comprehensive .NET WebAPI project with Entity Framework (EF) and MSSQL, following a layered architecture pattern, utilizing AutoMapper for object mapping, interfaces for abstraction, and Baseclass infrastructure for shared functionality.

## Introduction

This project is a robust .NET WebAPI solution designed to handle backend operations efficiently. It leverages the power of Entity Framework (EF) for database interactions, utilizing MSSQL as the underlying database system. Following a multi-layered architecture, the project implements various architectural patterns and best practices to ensure scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Technologies Used

- .NET Framework/Core
- Entity Framework (EF)
- Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)
- AutoMapper

## Project Structure

The project follows a layered architecture pattern, consisting of the following layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Contains controllers and API endpoints.
2. **Application Layer**: Implements business logic and application services.
3. **Domain Layer**: Defines domain models and business entities.
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides implementations for data access, logging, caching, etc.

   ## Features

- **WebApi Project:** A set of 11 tables have been established to store and manage data efficiently.
- **MVC Project:** An admin panel has been created with functionalities for adding, deleting, and updating records.
- **Entity Framework:** The project utilizes Entity Framework for data access and manipulation.
- **Dependency Injection:** Dependencies are injected from the outside, ensuring modularity and flexibility.
- **Automapper:** Automapper is employed for mapping between different object types, simplifying data manipulation.
- **MSSQL Database:** The database is built using MSSQL with the DbFirst approach.
- **Separate Projects:** MVC and WebApi projects are developed separately, adhering to a multi-layered architecture.
- **Modern Design Patterns:** The project follows the latest design patterns to ensure scalability and maintainability.
